# SocialExplore3D

A fun, interactive 3D social graph explorer right in your browser. Imagine a globe with your profile at the center and your friends radiating outwards like sparkling nodes. Drag, rotate, search, and connect in a modern, sleek interface.

## Key Features

‚Ä¢ **Browser-based 3D Canvas**: Built with Vite, React, React Three Fiber and Drei for smooth, GPU-accelerated visuals.
‚Ä¢ **Radial Network Layout**: Your user node stays fixed at the center. Friend nodes sit on an invisible sphere around you, connected by dynamic "spike" edges.
‚Ä¢ **Interactive Controls**: Click and drag any node along the sphere surface. Pan, zoom, and rotate the entire network or let it auto-spin.
‚Ä¢ **User Profiles**: Click a node to open a profile card. View details like name, phone, address, mutual friends, and your posts.
‚Ä¢ **Friend Requests**: Send, approve, or decline requests. Only friends see each other's private info (and neighbors-of-neighbors based on visibility settings).
‚Ä¢ **Posts & Visibility**: Upload images with live preview. Choose visibility: _Public_, _Friends_, or _Private_. Posts and friendships persist in localStorage, so they survive page reloads.
‚Ä¢ **Search Users**: Live-filter by name, respecting profile visibility rules. Works like a mini Facebook search.
‚Ä¢ **Settings Panel**: Toggle whether others see your connections, and switch your profile between public, friends-only, or private.
‚Ä¢ **Admin Tools**: If you're an admin, search any user and inspect their graph and posts.
